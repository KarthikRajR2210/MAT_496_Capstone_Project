## Medical Symptom Analyzer  
By Karthik Raj R (2210110344)


## Overview

The project takes in medical symptoms from the patient. Then a certain number of doctors from various specializations (which can be chosen by the user based on their area of interest, experience and university) offer their insights for the situation. After this the doctors provide a treatment plan for the patient from their expertise. (For example, if the symptom is back pain, an orthopedist and a physical therapist can have differing treatment plans). Finally, all the information from all doctors is summarized into a clean, easy to understand diagnosis for the patient(user), who can choose their treatment plan accordingly.

## Reason for picking up this project:

Getting perspective from multiple doctors is a very practical scenario. With the power of AI, getting data from all these perspectives is effective and simple. Furthermore, this use-case ensures a lot of the concepts learnt during the course can be applied. And most important of all, a model like this can be used by a layman in a day-to-day manner. 

The above reasons are why I have decided to try to make an application which diagnoses a symptom from various professional perspectives.

## Plan:

Here is a step by step plan for completion of the project (subject to change)

[TODO] Step-1: Create a template for a doctor (with qualifications, specialization, experience etc)  
[TODO] Step-2: Make a simple graph which incorporates human feedback to choose doctors according to the user's preference  
[TODO] Step-3: Get the doctors to analyze the patient's symptom (Big step, divide into substeps)  
[TODO] Step-3.1: Decide on method of generating information (possible ways include debate between the doctors, conversation with "expert" etc)  
[TODO] Step-3.2: Add web search capabilities (Tavily) and integrate parallelization (Maybe include retrieval of information from existing documents from folder i.e. RAG)  
[TODO] Step-3.3: Note down all the information obtained and make it into a summarization.  
[TODO] Step-4: Combine information from all doctors and give the patient a comprehensive and simple to understand diagnosis from various perspectives.(Possibly offer the patient mulitple "treatment plans" with its positives and negatives and they can choose accordingly)  
[TODO] Step-5: Integrate all the above steps into a working graph, which can take symptom from user, human interrupts for deciding doctors, and returning the final diagnosis.  

## Conclusion:
