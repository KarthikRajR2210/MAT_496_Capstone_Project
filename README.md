## Overview

The project takes in medical symptoms from the patient. Then a certain number of doctors from various specializations (which can be chosen by the user based on their area of interest, experience and university) offer their insights for the situation. After this the doctors provide a treatment plan for the patient from their expertise. (For example, if the symptom is back pain, an orthopedist and a physical therapist can have differing treatment plans). Finally, all the information from all doctors is summarized into a clean, easy to understand diagnosis for the patient(user), who can choose their treatment plan accordingly.

## Reason for picking up this project:

Getting perspective from multiple doctors is a very practical scenario. With the power of AI, getting data from all these perspectives is effective and simple. Furthermore, this use-case ensures a lot of the concepts learnt during the course can be applied. And most important of all, a model like this can be used by a layman in a day-to-day manner. 

The above reasons are why I have decided to try to make an application which diagnoses a symptom from various professional perspectives.
